Melon Loader mod for VrChat.

Press left ctrl+T to swap between 3 different modes, Off, Follow, and Stick. When not off, there will be a line between you and every other player in the world, color-coded by their nameplate color.  
In Follow mode, your end of the line will follow you as you move around.  
In Stick mode, your end of the line will stay where you activated it.

If a person changes avatar or joins the world, you need to reapply the mod to have a line between you and that player.
